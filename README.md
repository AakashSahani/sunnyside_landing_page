## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a lot in this challenge. Especially the menu and multiple styling were a hard.I used on CSS and HTML for this challenge as I want to understand both of these before moving on the Javascript.

### Continued development

I want to learn Responsive design and best practices for CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Oreilly HTML & CSS Course (PAID!)](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/modern-html-and/9781838822828/) - I took this course at the start of 2022. I learned how to make hamburger menu from Brad Traversy. I recommend him if you want to learn in-depth web development using Hands-on Projects.
